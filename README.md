# PAPER1
Used Cadence EDA, Jupyter Notebook. 

Implemented a robust CNN-based model for accurate identification of gate layouts, distinguishing between inverter, XOR, and XNOR gates in large circuits. Utilized Cadence EDA tools, Jupyter Notebooks, and Git for seamless integration, interactive development, and version control.
